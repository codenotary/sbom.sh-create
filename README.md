# sbom.sh-create
SBOM.sh container analysis and scan using Grype provided as a GitHub Action
# SBOM.sh GitHub Action

This GitHub Action integrates with [sbom.sh](https://sbom.sh/) to generate and upload Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for your projects. Utilizing the `codenotary/sbom.sh` container image, this action supports various open-source SBOM tools such as Trivy, Grype, and Syft.

## Features

- Generate SBOMs for filesystems and container images.
- Support for multiple scanning tools (Trivy, Grype, Syft).
- Upload SBOMs directly to sbom.sh and obtain a shareable URL.
- Optional vulnerability scanning and SBOM score calculation at sbom.sh.

## Workflow Dispatch Options

This action can be triggered manually using the `workflow_dispatch` event. You can provide the following inputs:

- `scan_type`: The type of scan to perform, such as `trivyfs`, `trivyimage`, `grypefs`, `grypeimage`, `syftfs`, or `syftimage`.
- `target`: The target for the scan, which is applicable for image scans.

When you navigate to the Actions tab of your GitHub repository, you will see an option to "Run workflow". You can select the branch you want to run the workflow on and provide the required inputs.


## Usage

To use this action, add the following to your `.github/workflows` directory in a file like `sbom-analysis.yml`:

```yaml
name: "Generate and Upload SBOM"

on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]

jobs:
  generate_sbom:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "SBOM Generation"
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Generate SBOM
        id: sbom_generation
        uses: codenotary/sbom.sh-create@main
        with:
          scan_type: 'grypefs'
          target: '.' # Assuming you want to scan the entire repository

      - name: Output SBOM URL
        run: echo "The SBOM can be found at $SBOM_SHARE_URL"

```

## Inputs
- `scan_type`: Type of scan (trivyfs, trivyimage, grypefs, grypeimage, syftfs, syftimage).
- `target`: Scan target (applicable for image scans).
